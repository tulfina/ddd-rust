# ddd-rust

## Overview
ddd-rust is a Rust library that provides foundational tools and patterns for implementing Domain-Driven Design (DDD) in your Rust applications. It aims to help you build well-structured, maintainable, and expressive domain models by providing abstractions and utilities for working with aggregates, events, commands, and more.

## Features

### Aggregates
Aggregates are fundamental building blocks in DDD that encapsulate a cluster of domain objects and enforce consistency rules within their boundaries. The ddd-rust library provides a set of traits and utilities to define and work with aggregates in your Rust code.

### Events
Events are crucial in DDD as they represent important occurrences or state changes within your domain. ddd-rust offers a mechanism for defining and handling events, allowing you to decouple the components of your system and ensure proper communication between different parts of your domain.

### Commands
Commands enable you to model user intentions or requests within your domain. ddd-rust provides a way to define and process commands, allowing you to validate and execute them based on the rules and logic specific to your domain.

### Value Objects
Value objects represent immutable values that are an integral part of your domain. They are crucial for expressing concepts and behaviors that go beyond simple primitive types. The ddd-rust library provides utilities for defining and working with value objects, making it easier to handle complex domain concepts.
